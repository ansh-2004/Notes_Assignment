# LangChain Model Component

- LangChain have 2 different types of Model :- Language Model and Embedding Model
- In Language model , we give text as input and model interprets this text and give text as output. 
- In Embedding model , we give text as input and model interprets this text and give series of numbers as output . These numbers are called embeddings and these set of numbers are called vectors . These numbers represent the contextual meaning of the input text .

- With the help of language model , we make chat bot type application
- Embedding model are useful in semantic search . So they are useful in making RAG based application. The company pdf example we have seen before is an RAG based application.

    Semantic search is a technology that goes beyond matching keywords to understand the context and intent of a user's query, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to provide more relevant and accurate results. Instead of just finding exact words, it analyzes the meaning and relationships between words to deliver content that aligns with what the user is truly looking for, making the search experience more intuitive and personalized`

## Language Models
- In language models , we have two types of models:- LLMs and Chat Models 

- LLMs are general purpose models which means we can use them in any kind of NLP application . You can do text generation , text summarization , code generation , question /answering. We give LLMs string in plain text and it turns around and gives you a string in plain text . But these LLMs are now replaced by chat models.

- Chat Models are these language models used for conversation tasks. means if you want to create a chat bot , then chat models are great. In this we can put multiple messages simultaneously as input and chat model can understand this conversation and reply with a series of messages 

## Setup 

- For the first project , we need these dependencies
- langchain , @langchain/openai and openai , @langchain/anthropic, @langchain/google-genai
