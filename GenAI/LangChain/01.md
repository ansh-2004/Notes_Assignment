- Embeddings, or vectors, are numerical representations of data—like words, images, or sounds—in a high-dimensional space. They are mathematical arrays of numbers generated by an embedding model, with similar data points mapped closer together to capture their semantic meaning and relationships. This numerical format allows machine learning models to process and analyze complex, unstructured data, enabling tasks such as semantic search, text translation, and recommendation systems


- The brain we are talking about in page 8 , is nothing but LLMs . And It is difficult to use LLMs in our own server because they require high compution, so what LLMs companies like openai , anthorpy do , they said we run LLMs in our own servers , they provide us API , Using API we can talk to these LLMs . So brain is nothing but LLM API .
