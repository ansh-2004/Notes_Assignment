// 2nd Roadmap 

1. Intro to GenAI & LLMs
- what is gen ai ? LLMs ? RAG?
- overview of OpenAI , Hugging Face and GPT 

2. Prompt Engineering and Token Management
- Zero-shot , Few-shot , chain-of-thought
- Temperature, top_p , tokens , max_length

3. LangChain Essentials
- chains, tools,agents , memory , prompttemplates

4. RAG 
- intro to embeddings and vector stores
- chromaDB,Pinecone
- cosine similarity,chunking,indexing

5. Agents and tools 
- LangChain agents explained  
- ReAct, MRKL, Tool usage

6. LangGraph & MultiAgent systems
- LangGraph intro
- Graph based reasoning
- building agent workflows

7. API Deployment + Web App integration 
- Serving LLM Apps with FastApi
- API routing,auth , JSON I/O 

8. MCP 

9. Bonus modules
- fine-tuning vs RAG 
- Open-source LLMs: LLaMA, Mistral,Ollama
- Local vector DBs and embedding models (Instructor-XL)
- Cost optimization techiques(token counting, streaming)
- Use Hugging Face transformers directly
