- When you create a bucket and going to upload a object in this object , you have option to select Storage classes
- You can also manually change the storage class later of the object
- To automate moving these objects between differnet storage classes, we use **lifecycle rules**.
- Go to bucket , under management we have lifecycle rules , create it 
    - Give it name DemoRule
    - Choose a rule scope , apply to all objects in the bucket . Or you can also choose limit the cope of this rule using one more more filters 
    - Under the lifecycle rule actions , we have many options
        - Transition current versions of objects between storage classes: This action will move current versions.
        - Transition noncurrent versions of objects between storage classes: This action will move noncurrent versions.
        - Expire current versions of objects 
        - Permanently delete noncurrent versions of objects
        - Delete expired object delete markers or incomplete multipart uploads
    - These actions are not supported when filtering by object tags or object size.
- If you choose first , you will then choose in which storage classes to move it and in how many days. You can choose multiple. 
    - Like go to IA after 30 days
    - go to glacier after 60 days and so on .
