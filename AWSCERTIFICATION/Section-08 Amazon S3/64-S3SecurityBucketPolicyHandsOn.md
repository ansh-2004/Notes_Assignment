- To make a bucket policy , so to access the coffee file from the public URL ,
- For this go under the permissions tab of bucket
- The first thing we have to do is to allow public access from the bucket settings because right now everything is blocked. So edit to and untick this
- Now edit the bucket policy , use policy generator (now policy generator is not integrated inside s3 console , you need to open in separte tab )
    - Select type of policy as **S3 Bucket Policy** 
    - Select Effect **Allow**
    - In prinicpal , type * as we want to allow anyone on Amazon s3 service to perform getobject (getobject means to read objects)
    - The amazon resource name (ARN) must be the bucket name with a slash , and then with a star. So copy the bucket arn and paste it here. Also add a /* at last **arn:aws:s3:::anshgupta-demo-s3-v1/* **. The reason we do this because the getObject action we choose applies to objects within your buckets and therefore objects within your bucket are after a slash and * to represent these objects
- Add all these statements and generate policy  . copy this policy and paste in AWS s3 bucket policy 
- Now go to your coffee.jpg object and open with the object URL . We see it will open now. Not only this every object in our bucket is now public .
