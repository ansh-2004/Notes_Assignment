# Multi-Session Support

- On the root-user account , Turn on Multi-Session support
- By this, i can have a specific role or account in the browser and then I can add a session and sign into any of your identities using the same browser.Click on Add session” button in the account menu, or sign in to any of your identities using your usual method.
- This simple benefit that we can have 2 different account on the same browser which was not possible before, because if in the same browser we try to sign in to different account , first account will get log out automatically
