- Cloud Computing is the **on-demand delivery** of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- Through a cloud services platform with **pay-as-you-go pricing**
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need . 
- You can access as many resources as you need , almost instantly
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and set of application services
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application. 


## The Deployment Models of the Cloud
- There are different kinds of clouds out there. 
- The first one is called a **private cloud** and the provider is , **rackspace**. It is cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public. So you get your own private cloud, you own private data center , just mananed by someone else. You still have complete control over it. And more security for a sensitive application which may need some specific business needs.
- The second is **Public cloud**  and the providers are Microsoft azure , Google Cloud and AWS. In this, cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet. 
- The third is **Hybrid Cloud**. In this we are going to keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities on the cloud. We chave control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure but we will have flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

## The Five characteristics of Cloud Computing
- On-demand self service: Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
- Broad network access: Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:- Multiple customers can share the same infrastucture and applications with security and privacy. Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
- Rapid elasticity and scalability: Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed. Quickly and easily scale based on demand
- Measured Service: Usage is measured , users pay correctly for what they used. 

## Six advantages of Cloud Computing
- Trade capital expence(CAPEX) for operational expence(OPEX): That means , you don't own hardware , you pay on-demand and that will reduce Total cost of Ownership(TCO) & Operational Expense(OPEX). Means you rent hardware from aws , no need to buy 
- Benefit from massive economies of scale: Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- Stop guessing capacity: Scale based on actual measured usage according to our application
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

## Problems solved by the cloud
- Flexibility: change resource types when needed
- Cost-Effective: pay as you go, for what you use
- Scalability:- accomodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
- Agiltiy: rapidly develop , test and launch software applications
