## How Websites Work

- We have a server hosted somewhere , and we as a web browser, want to get access to that server to visualize a websites. 
- What we are going to do as a client is use a network. A network between ourselves and the server, and the client will find the network and will use network to route the packets, the data into the server, then the server will reply to us, and we will get the response, and we can view a website. 
- Now for the clients to find the server, and the server to find the clients, you need to have IP addressess. So clients have IP addresses and servers also have IP addresses. And so the idea is that when you use an IP address, you can send a request to wherever you want to the server you want, and the server can know how to find you back. 

## What is a server composed of?
- Well a server is going to contain a **CPU** for **Computation**. CPU is a little piece that will be doing some computations, it will be very helpful to do some calculations and find results. 
- Your server also needs **RAM, or memory**. This is going to be very , very fast memory, which will allow us to store information and retrieve it very quickly.
