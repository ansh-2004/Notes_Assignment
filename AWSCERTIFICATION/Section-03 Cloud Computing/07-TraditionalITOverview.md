## How Websites Work

- We have a server hosted somewhere , and we as a web browser, want to get access to that server to visualize a websites. 
- What we are going to do as a client is use a network. A network between ourselves and the server, and the client will find the network and will use network to route the packets, the data into the server, then the server will reply to us, and we will get the response, and we can view a website. 
- Now for the clients to find the server, and the server to find the clients, you need to have IP addressess. So clients have IP addresses and servers also have IP addresses. And so the idea is that when you use an IP address, you can send a request to wherever you want to the server you want, and the server can know how to find you back. 

## What is a server composed of?
- Well a server is going to contain a **CPU** for **Computation**. CPU is a little piece that will be doing some computations, it will be very helpful to do some calculations and find results. 
- Your server also needs **RAM, or memory**. This is going to be very , very fast memory, which will allow us to store information and retrieve it very quickly.

- So cpu + memory = brain
- Now we also need to have some more long-term **storage of data**. In computers we have some special storage to store data, for example, files, 
- And then if we want to store **data in more sturctured way , we're going to use a database**
- Finally in server, we're also going to have some **networking aspect. like Routers, switch, DNS server**

- Cloud will give all these things on demand

## IT Terminology
- Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other
- Router: A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. They know where to send your packets on the internet. 
- Switch: Takes a packet and send it to the correct server/client on you network

client computer ---> router -----> switch -----> computer1
                                          -----> computer2
                                          -----> computer3



## Traditionally, how to build infrastructure
- Traditionally they set up infrastructure in thier own home or garage. they buy the server and set up in their garage. 
- Now as your website grows, they need more and more servers 
- When you company grows bigger , you move to office where you have a special room which is to called a data center. In data center, you will be adding more and more servers. 

## Problems with traditional IT approach
- Pay for the rent for the data center
- Pay for power supply , cooling and maintenance
- Adding and replacing hardware takes time
- Scaling is limited
- Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastruce
- How to deal with disaster? (Earthquake, power shutdown , fire...)

- Can we externalize all this? Yes using cloud
