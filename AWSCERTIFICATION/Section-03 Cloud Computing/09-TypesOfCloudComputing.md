## Types of Cloud Computing
- Infrastructure as a Service(Iaas) :- This is to provide the building blocks for cloud IT. With this, we are going to provide networking , computers , data storage space in its raw form
- Platform as a Service(PaaS):- Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure. so that you can just focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
- Software as a Service(SaaS) : Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

# Example

- In **On-premises** you are going to manage everything
    Applications
    Data
    Runtime
    Middleware
    O/S
    Virtualization
    Servers
    Storage
    Networking

- In **IaaS**, we are going to manage 
    Applications
    Data
    Runtime
    Middleware
    OS

    The rest of things Virtualization , servers , storage , Networking will be managed by AWS

- In **PaaS** , we will manage only **Applications and Data**. Rest from Runtime to Networking will be managed by AWS

- In **SaaS** , everything from Applications to Networking will be managed by AWS


## Example of cloud Computing Types
- IaaS : Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
- PaaS : Elastic Beanstalk(on AWS)
- SaaS: Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning). Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom
