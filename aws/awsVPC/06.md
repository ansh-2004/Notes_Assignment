- Now the NAT instance we made in previous lecture to access internet in private instance is not more recommended because first we need to manage it our own
- also if we have multiple private instance but our nat instance is only t2 micro therefore network interface is very limited on this . But we want like to pass 100gb data per second so scalibity for nat instance is very difficult

- So instead of NAT instance use NAT Gateway. 
- So go to vpc > NAT gateway > create NAT gateway
- name this and select public subnet . allocate elastic ip 
- now go to private route table and edit it and change target to nat gateway you made 
- with nat gateway , traffic will only go outside of private instance, we can't still access private gateway from outside

# Network Access Control List (NACL)

- my website was hosted on ec2 instance and suddenly there is attack on my website and multiple request per second coming to my ec2 instance again and again which causes the problem to my server 
-  so also only particular 5 ip address were there from where these requests are coming
- so i had to do something that on my ec2 instance , if anyone in the whole world is sending request to this ec2 instance of mine, then the request should reach it , but request shloud not come from these 5 ip addresses. 
- now we can think of security group here , but in security group we only allow that if any request comes from this ip address should be accepted. if it is coming from this subnet then it should be accepted . If it is coming on this port then it should be accepted . But in this case we need to deny request that if request coming from this , the don't accept, throw from outside , the request should not reach the server .
- security group is placed just before your ec2 instance. From there , the request gets
