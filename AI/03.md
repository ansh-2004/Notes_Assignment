## Machine Learning 

- How do we teach machines without having to explicity program them ?
- We teach them with data, a process called machine learning. 
- Machine learning is a sub-field of artificial intelligence based on statistics.
- It involes a machine, learning how to solve a problem without being explicitly programmed to do so . 
- The machines are able to do this by detecting statistical patterns in data. 
- Essentially , with machine learning, we use existing data and a training algorithm to learn a model of the data. 
- We can then feed new data into that model that it's never seen before and make predictions about the new data. 
- A machine learning model is essentially a function , It's simply a mapping from an input to an output .
- In this case , it takes a data as an input and produces a prediction as an output . 
- For eg, imagine we have a conveyor belt of fruit of different sizes , we need to separate the apples from the bananas as they go by. However, we only have sensor readings of each fruit's length and height . How would we build a model to predict which fruit is an apple and which fruit is a banana ? 
- First we would need to create a table of data called a training set. This dataset contains the lengths and heights of a bunch of randomly selected apples and bananas. 
- When recording this data, a human would label each type of fruit in each row as either an apple or banana based on visual inspection. 
- Next we would feed these data into a machine learning training algorithm . The algorithm would inspect each row of data containing the length ,  height and type of fruit. 
- The algorithm would learn how length and height correlate with each type of fruit. Apples are more round , and bananas are more elongated. 
- The machine learning training algorithm captures the statistical relationship as a mathemtical model . 
- Now we can use this data to make predictions. We can feed this model a new apple and banana that it's never seen before. And the model will tell us whether the new fruit is an apple or a banana. 
- More precisely, it will tell us a statistical likelihood that the new fruit is either an apple or a banana .

- There are lot of tasks that we can perform with machine learning. 
- For eg, classification , regression , clustering and anomaly detection .
- Classification is where we make a decision or prediction involving two or more categories or outcomes.
