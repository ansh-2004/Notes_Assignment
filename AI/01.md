#### What is artificial Intelligence and How this artificial intelligence different from natural intelligence ??

### Types of Intelligence
1. Natural Intelligence
2. Artificial Intelligence 

# Natural Intelligence
- It is the type of intelligence that living organisms are born with and acquire over their lives. This includes organic intelligence , like that of humans , animals, insects and even bacteria. It also includes collective intelligence , like a school of fish, a swarm of bees or a colony of ants. 

# Artificial Intelligence
- It is a type of intelligence that is not naturally occurring. 
- It is intelligence that was created artificially by humans using machines. 
- Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a machine to replicate natural intelligence . This includes replicating human-like intelligence, other organic intelligence or collective intelligence. 
- If a machine is capable of recreating the same decisions and actions that a natural intelligence would produce, then it is a type of artificial intelligence.
- Hence, artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine to perceive an environment and to choose actions that maximize the expected likelihood of achieving a goal.
