# What is Intelligence?
- The ability of an agent to perceive an environment and to choose actions that increase its chances of achieving a goal of some kind by **learning , knowledge , reasoning , planning etc.**


- Example for Intelligence for different agent 

    | Agent | Environment | Goal    | Perception | Action   |
    |-------|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
    | Human | Exam        | Pass    | Read       | Solve    |
    | Mouse | Maze        | Cheese  | See        | Navigate |
    | Ants  | Colony      | Protect | Smell      | Attack   |


- These **learning , knowledge , reasoning , planning etc.** can be called as the components of intelligence but there are more components than these . 


### What is artificial Intelligence and How this artificial intelligence different from natural intelligence ??

# Types of Intelligence
1. Natural Intelligence
2. Artificial Intelligence 

## Natural Intelligence
- It is the type of intelligence that living organisms are born with and acquire over their lives. This includes organic intelligence , like that of humans , animals, insects and even bacteria. It also includes collective intelligence , like a school of fish, a swarm of bees or a colony of ants. 

## Artificial Intelligence
- It is a type of intelligence that is not naturally occurring. 
- It is intelligence that was created artificially by humans using machines. 
- Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a machine to replicate natural intelligence . This includes replicating human-like intelligence, other organic intelligence or collective intelligence. 
- If a machine is capable of recreating the same decisions and actions that a natural intelligence would produce, then it is a type of artificial intelligence.
- Hence, **artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine to perceive an environment and to choose actions that maximize the expected likelihood of achieving a goal**. 

- In this defination , The agent is a machine of some kind. This includes software running on a computer , a robot or any other kind of man-made artifact. 
- By environment , we could mean the physical world, as is the case with robots and self-driving cars; However it could also mean virtual worlds like video games, a computer simulation or a set of data. 
- By actions , we mean physical actions like moving, grasping and speaking or virtual actions like producting data as an output or making a decision or prediction of some kind. 
- By expected likelihood, we mean the statistical probability of success that an agent associates with a given action .  
- AI agents maximize their chances of success mathematically using software rather than organic brains. 
- And by goal , we mean any objective that the agent was designed to achieve. This could include physical goals like cleaning your living room floor, driving you safely to work. It could also include virtual goals like winning a video game, or solving a complex math problem . 

# Types of AI 
- There are 3 main types of AI 
1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence 
2. Artificial General Intelligence 
3. Artificial Super Intelligence 

## Artificial Narrow Intelligence 
- Artificial Narrow Intelligence  or narrow AI , is a type of AI designed to solve a very narrow set of specific problems. 
- For eg, OpenAI's chatGPT can answer questions , Amazon Alexa can respond to basic voice commands and Google's Waymo is a self-driving car. 

## Artificial General Intelligence 
- Artificial General Intelligence , or general AI , is a type of general-purpose intelligence that can solve a wide variety to problems . 
- General AI is commonly associated with sentient robots in books, TV, and film like R2-D2 , Data from Star Trek, OR HAL 9000
- It is any AI that can do 50% of all economically valuable work as well or better than 50% of all humans .
- Current LLMs from OpenAI, Antrhopic , Google are beginning to exhibit generalized intelligence . b

## Artificial Super Intelligence
- Artificial Super Intelligence , super AI, is a type of futuristic AI that is smarter than all human or natural intelligence. 
- Super AIs are typically the super villains in sci-fi movies. For eg, skynet from the terminator, Ultron from the Avengers and the Architect from The Matrix. 

# Components of AI 
- What Components are necessary to create Artificial Intelligence? What does it take to make a machine intelligent?

- Hence, the components includes Perception, Learning, Knowledge, reasoning, and planning.

## Perception
- Perception is the ability of an agent to deduce a state of its environment from sensory data. 
- Data comes into agent via sensors like cameras , microphones and radar. 
- The agent makes sense of this stream of data by recognize patterns in the data. 
- Through this pattern, the agent is able to detect the features of the environment , like walls, objects, and people 
- The aspect of these features like their size, position , velocity make up the current state of the environment 

## Learning 
- Learning is the ability of an agent to extract knowledge from a stream of data. 
- Learning involves taking in data as input and producing a decision, prediction or an action as output. 
- For AI agent, this involves learning how to map the state of the environment to actions that lead to a goal .  This will be done by advances in machine learning . 

## Knowledge
- Knowledge is the ability of an agent to represent what it has learned in a flexible way . 
- Knowledge is a collection of information that the agent knows about its environment, including objects, their properites , and their relationships. 
- An agent's knowledge can be represented symbolically as a statistical model or as a knowledge graph.
- Each of these types of knowledge representations has its own various pros and cons. 

## Reasoning
- Reasoning is the ability of an agent to infer conclusions from available knowledge.
- Reasoning agents employ inference techniques like deduction, which uses a set of premises to reach a specific conclusion, and Induction which generalizes from a set of observations to a more general rule. 
- Reasoning is how we use knowledge to solve problems without having to resort to trial and error for each new situation.  


```
in simple terms 

### 🧠 What is Reasoning?
Reasoning means **thinking things through** to figure out answers or make decisions using what you already know.


### 🔍 How Do Reasoning Agents Think?
Reasoning agents (like smart robots or AI systems) use two main thinking methods:

- **Deduction**: This is like solving a puzzle using clues. You start with known facts and use them to reach a specific conclusion.  
  *Example:*  
  - All birds have feathers.  
  - A parrot is a bird.  
  - So, a parrot has feathers.

- **Induction**: This is learning from experience. You notice patterns and make general rules.  
  *Example:*  
  - You see the sun rise every morning.  
  - You guess: “The sun rises every day.”
 

### 🧩 Why Is Reasoning Useful?
Reasoning helps us **solve problems smartly**. Instead of trying random solutions (trial and error), we use what we already know to make good choices quickly.

```

## Planning
- Planning is the ability of an agent to set and achieve a goal. 
- This typically involves constructing a set of sub-goals to achieve the primary goal as well. 
- Planning involves an agent being able to visualize future states of the environment.
- The agent must be able to predict how a series of possible actions will change the state of the environment and laid it either closer to or further away from its goal. 
- With this information , the agent can then choose the action that maximizes the likelihood of achieving its goal. 


```
Modern narrow AI applications do not require all five of these components of artificial intelligence.

Infact, many successful narrow AI application involve just one or two of these components

```

| **Component** | **What It Means** | **What It Does** |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Perception** | Seeing and hearing | AI uses sensors (like cameras or microphones) to understand its surroundings by recognizing patterns—like spotting people, objects, or movement. |
| **Learning** | Learning from experience | AI takes in data and learns how to make decisions or predictions. It figures out which actions help it reach a goal. |
| **Knowledge** | Storing what it knows | AI organizes what it has learned—facts about objects, people, and relationships—so it can use that info later. |
| **Reasoning** | Thinking logically | AI uses what it knows to solve problems or make conclusions without guessing. It can think through situations using logic. |
| **Planning** | Making smart choices | AI sets goals and plans steps to reach them. It predicts what will happen next and picks the best actions to succeed. |

Each part plays a unique role:
- **Perception** helps AI understand the world.
- **Learning** helps it improve over time.
- **Knowledge** helps it remember and organize what it knows.
- **Reasoning** helps it think smartly.
- **Planning** helps it act wisely.
